** First Time flash guide**

When you flash your .bin file (to 0x0x8000000, no bootloader need , support for chainload from bootloader comming ) (or flash elf via platform io) 
you wont have fonts/icons the first time you flash from factory MKS, 
place MKS folder from "Copy to SD Card root directory to update" folder to root of SD-CARD,create reset.txt in root of SD-CARD 
reset MKS unit and system will flash fonts & icons then do touch calibration and store results.

future flash &/or font updates will be readable as fonts stored on SPI EEPROM chip. 



Firmware boots at 0x8000000
reset.txt in root of SDCARD triggers reset of system params and touch calibration screen
files in <SDCARD>/MKS/ are fonts & icons
