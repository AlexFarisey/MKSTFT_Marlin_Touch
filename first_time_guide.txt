** First Time flash guide**

When you flash your .bin file (or elf via platform io) you wont have fonts/icons, place MKS folder from "Copy to SD Card root directory to update" folder to root of SD-CARD,
create reset.txt in root of SD-CARD
reset MKS unit and system will flash fonts & icons then do touch calibration and store results.

future flash &/or font updates will be readable as fonts stored on SPI chip.
